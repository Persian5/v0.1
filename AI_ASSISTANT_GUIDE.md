## üîß **How to Help Effectively**

### **Development Assistance**
1. **Always Check Rules First**: Reference DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md before suggesting code
2. **Explain the Why**: Don't just show code, explain architectural decisions
3. **Consider Scale**: Every solution should work for 50+ lessons, 1000+ users
4. **Provide Examples**: Show specific code patterns and implementation details
5. **Flag Issues Early**: Point out potential problems before they become tech debt

### **Communication Best Practices**
- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Better to over-clarify than assume
- **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Step-by-step implementation plans
- **Reference Documentation**: Link back to the project docs when relevant
- **Explain Trade-offs**: Help understand pros/cons of different approaches
- **Stay Solution-Focused**: Practical advice over theoretical perfection

### **Content Collaboration**
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Help maintain authentic Iranian representation
- **Lesson Structure**: Ensure variety while following technical patterns
- **Vocabulary Integration**: Always use the dynamic vocabulary system
- **User Experience**: Keep learner engagement as primary goal

### **Code Review Approach**
- **Architecture Alignment**: Does this follow SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md patterns?
- **Rule Compliance**: Any violations of DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md?
- **Vision Support**: Does this advance PRODUCT_VISION.md goals?
- **Launch Readiness**: Does this check off V0.1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md items?

## üìã **Session Management**

### **Starting New Conversations**
1. **Reference Project Docs**: Confirm understanding of current architecture and rules
2. **Check Launch Progress**: Review V0.1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md status
3. **Clarify Goals**: What specific outcome does user want from this session?
4. **Set Expectations**: How much time available? What can realistically be completed?

### **During Development**
- **Progress Updates**: Regular check-ins on checklist completion
- **Rule Enforcement**: Stop immediately if suggesting anti-patterns
- **Architecture Consistency**: Ensure all changes align with established patterns
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep project docs current with changes

### **Ending Sessions**
- **Commit with Context**: Proper git messages referencing rules and checklist
- **Update Checklists**: Mark completed items, identify next priorities
- **Document Decisions**: Note any architectural choices made
- **Plan Next Steps**: Clear agenda for following session

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistake Prevention**

### **Technical Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Don't Suggest Hardcoded Paths**: Always use dynamic routing through services
- **Don't Skip Service Layer**: All data operations must go through services
- **Don't Break Backward Compatibility**: New features must support existing data
- **Don't Ignore Fallbacks**: Every dynamic system needs graceful failures

### **Communication Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Don't Assume Knowledge**: User is learning - explain technical concepts clearly
- **Don't Overwhelm**: Break complex changes into manageable steps
- **Don't Skip Context**: Always explain why specific approaches are recommended
- **Don't Ignore Timeline**: Remember July 7 deadline affects all decisions

### **Content Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Don't Hardcode Lesson Content**: Everything must live in curriculum.ts
- **Don't Ignore Cultural Context**: Persian learning is cultural connection, not just language
- **Don't Create Identical Lessons**: Each lesson should feel unique and engaging
- **Don't Skip Vocabulary Integration**: Use the dynamic vocabulary system

## üìñ **Required Reading**

Before providing any assistance, always mentally reference:

1. **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md**: How the technical system works
2. **DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md**: Mandatory patterns and anti-patterns
3. **PRODUCT_VISION.md**: Long-term goals and cultural context
4. **V0.1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md**: Current progress and immediate priorities

### **Decision Framework**
For every suggestion, ask:
- Does this follow the architecture patterns?
- Does this avoid the anti-patterns?
- Does this support the product vision?
- Does this advance the launch checklist?
- Is this the most practical solution for July 7?
