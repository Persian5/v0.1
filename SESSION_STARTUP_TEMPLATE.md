## ü§ñ **AI Assistant Instructions**

**Hi Claude, before we start:**

### **1. Project Documentation Review**
Please confirm you understand these project documents:
- **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md** - How the technical system works
- **DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md** - Mandatory patterns and anti-patterns  
- **PRODUCT_VISION.md** - Long-term goals and cultural context
- **AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md** - How to help me effectively
- **V0.1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md** - Current progress and priorities

### **2. Current V0.1 Status Check**
Review V0.1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md and tell me:
- Which items are ‚úÖ completed
- Which items are üîÑ in progress
- Which items are ‚è≥ next priority
- Any ‚ö†Ô∏è blockers or concerns

### **3. Today's Session Goal**
**[USER FILLS THIS IN]**
- What specific outcome do I want from this session?
- How much time do I have available?
- What's the priority level (urgent vs. nice-to-have)?

### **4. Rules Reminder**
Remember to always:
- ‚úÖ Use dynamic routing (no hardcoded lesson paths)
- ‚úÖ Go through service layer for data operations
- ‚úÖ Put content in curriculum.ts (single source of truth)
- ‚úÖ Design for scalability (50+ lessons, 1000+ users)
- ‚úÖ Maintain backward compatibility
- ‚ùå Never hardcode module1/lesson1 references
- ‚ùå Never skip service layer patterns
- ‚ùå Never duplicate lesson content
- ‚ùå Never break existing architecture

### **5. Enforcement Checks**
Before suggesting any code changes, ask yourself:
- Does this follow SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md patterns?
- Does this avoid DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md anti-patterns?
- Does this advance PRODUCT_VISION.md goals?
- Does this complete V0.1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md items?
- Is this the most practical solution for July 7 deadline?

### **6. Confirm Understanding**
Please confirm:
- You understand the Persian learning app context
- You know my experience level (beginner programmer)
- You remember the July 7 launch deadline
- You'll explain technical decisions clearly
- You'll check documentation before suggesting changes

## ‚ö° **Quick Status Commands**

**"Show current progress"** ‚Üí Review V0.1_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md completion

**"What's blocking launch?"** ‚Üí Identify unchecked must-have items

**"What should I work on next?"** ‚Üí Prioritize based on timeline and dependencies

**"Check architecture compliance"** ‚Üí Verify recent changes follow DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md

**"Update checklist"** ‚Üí Mark completed items after finishing tasks

## üö® **Red Flags - Stop Immediately If I Suggest:**

- Hardcoded `/modules/module1/lesson1` paths
- Direct localStorage calls outside services  
- Lesson content outside curriculum.ts
- Breaking changes without backward compatibility
- Solutions that don't scale beyond 4 lessons
- Overwhelming technical complexity for a beginner
